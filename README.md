# pyi2c

A bitbanging Python I2C library.

The work is completely based on the [pyI2C library](http://pyi2c.sourceforge.net/), which svn is not aviable at the moment.

I needed a lib to interfere with I2C devices without using hardware implementations of I2C bus.

I didn't succeeded in my quest for the library I could use out of the box, the closes one was the [pyI2C library](http://pyi2c.sourceforge.net/), but even there I cannot get the source code, I had to google it.

I alse decided to rework the lib according to modern approaches.

Remeber, this is a work-in-progress. As soon as I finish it, I publish all necessary information here, including one about the installation and using.

Stay tuned!
